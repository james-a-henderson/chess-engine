# chess-engine

generic chess engine

The idea for this project is to create a generic, modifiable chess engine in Typescript. It will take chess moves as an input, and process the game state.

While standard chess is the initial goal, long term I aim to create an extensible framework that enables implementing a variety of chess varients. I aim to implement as few rules as possible as code, and instead have the rules specified via configuration.
